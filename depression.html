<br><br><h2>Understanding Depression</h2><br><br>
      
<p><b>One of the most major and common types of mental health disorders, depression affects a person's thinking processes, feeling moments, and ability to deal with daily living. Depression is more than just feeling down or having a rough time; it brings intense emotional distress to a person and can make the most mundane activities seem difficult or impossible to carry out. Patients suffering from depression may exhibit signs of persistent melancholy, lack of interest in social activities, tiredness, change in appetite or sleeplessness, loss in concentration, or feelings that they are not worthy or hopeless. Premeditated by many factors, depression can be due to an imbalance in brain chemistry, or one could inherit it genetically; at other times, trauma or stressors throughout life contribute to it. Often, depression feels almost isolating; however, it is highly treatable. With the right support and treatment, including therapy and good self-care, with medication as necessary, many people can manage their symptoms well and enjoy fulfilling lives. CalmPath Therapy shall walk with you all along the healing and well-being path.</b></p>
      
<p><b>When these feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or lack of interest in activities are persistent, it can be a sign of depression and therefore could warrant consultation with a mental health professional. These feelings tend to interfere in daily functioning, social relationships, work, and well-being. It would be important to remember that there is nothing weak about feeling like this, and if you think that you are alone, you are not. Mental health issues like depression are real, valid, and treatable. Seeking help is a courageous and very important step in gaining clarity about what you are going through and starting your healing. At CalmPath Therapy, our caring therapists partner with you to provide compassionate care and treatment that meets your needs.</b></p><br><br><br>
