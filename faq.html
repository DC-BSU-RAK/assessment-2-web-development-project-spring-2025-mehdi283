<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br><br><br>
      

<div class="faq">


        
<h3>What services do this medical center offer?</h3><br>
        
<p>We provide full-spectrum mental health services that address your particular needs, including individual psychotherapy for anxiety and depression, as well as family counseling for better relationships. We use evidence-based practices to help you find your way to emotional wellness and personal development, and our compassionate professionals stay right by your side.</p><br><br>


        
<h3>What is the usual duration of treatment?</h3><br>
        
<p>The most patients will usually report gains after 5-10 weeks, depending on the patient’s particular condition. This period may vary depending on type of treatment, seriousness of the condition and how a person reacts to a therapy. Mental health problems such as anxiety or depression may improve within weeks when a person is consistently undergoing therapy or taking medications. More complicated conditions or a worse scenario, however, might require a longer duration before improvements become observable, which warrants a continued treatment and involvement.</p><br><br>

        

<h3>Are the consultations private?</h3><br>
        

<p>All therapy sessions and medical consultations are totally kept secret and therefore one’s information is not shared with anyone unless the individual consents. It is this confidentiality that makes it possible for victims to speak out about their concerns openly and honestly without feeling that their privacy would be violated in the process. It is a hallmark in healthcare and therapy, which ensures rights of patients and establishes trust in therapeutic relation.</p><br><br>

        

<h3>Do I require a referral to schedule an appointment?</h3><br>
        

<p>No, you can call our office directly and book an appointment with us through our website or phone. There is no need to obtain a referral from another healthcare provider, meaning that the process is effortless and fast. Whether you are looking for therapy, medical advice or other services, it is very easy to set a schedule that works the best for you. Our online service for booking is easy to use and if you have any questions or would like us to book a time for you, please give us a call. We want your experience of getting care to be as easy and stress-free as possible.</p><br><br>

        

<h3>What credentials do your therapists possess?</h3><br>
        

<p>All our therapists are certified clinical psychologists or psychiatrists with vast experience on their respective fields. They are highly professional individuals that know what to do and how to do it in order to make therapy and treatment effective. Their skills guarantees you a high quality of care that is tailor-made to your individual needs. If you have mental health challenges or need advice in any field, you can be sure that our team has the required qualifications and experience to help you.</p><br><br>



        
<h3>Do you provide sessions online?</h3><br>
        

<p>Yes, we have in-person and online therapy sessions that you can use to have a convenient schedule that meets your needs. Whether you prefer the face-to-face interaction or the convenience of accessing therapy at home, we make sure you can access the support needed in whichever way is best for you. Both alternatives promise undiminished high quality for such care and attention.</p><br><br>




<h3>Does insurance cover your clinic?</h3><br>
        

<p>We accept most major insurance providers in order for us to make your care convenient and more affordable. In order to ensure your particular plan is included, please contact us directly to confirm. Our team is glad to assist you with any questions in relation to insurance and lead you in the process, so you have good experience.</p><br><br>

       
 
<h3>After I start, is it possible for me to switch therapists?</h3><br>
        

<p>Yes, you can change your therapist if you are not comfortable with him/her at any time. Your comfort and trust is important to our therapeutic process and we want you to feel we are fully by your side during your journey. We are here to make sure you have a good match for your needs.</p><br><br>

        

<h3>Which age ranges are you treating?</h3><br>
        

<p>We treat children, adolescents, adults and seniors, providing tailored services to cater for the specific needs of every category of persons. Our therapists’ methodology varies according to age, and is effective in giving assistance, from play therapy for kids, to guidance for teens, to specialized care for adults and older adults. All treatment plans are tailored to meet an individual’s level of life and the specific concerns about his or her life.</p><br><br>
