<h3>Personal Counseling</h3><br>
        
<p>Private one-on-one sessions are made available to you, wherein we would attempt to explore and address your particular mental health issues within the confidentiality and safety of such an environment. The individual therapy sessions allow a person to work hard with a treating professional who focuses treatment toward that client's particular need: anxiety, depression, trauma, or pure stress from the day-to-day. The cost for a 50-minute mental health therapy session with any of our therapists is $125, which we feel is well worth investing in your future. When considering the benefits that could include long-term emotional development, stronger coping mechanisms, and a more balanced life, this money is in fact well spent.</p>

<h3>Method for Treating Anxiety</h3><br>
